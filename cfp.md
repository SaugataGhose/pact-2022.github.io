# Call for Papers

{{ conf_name }} will be held on {{ conf_dates }} in **Chicago, IL**.

**Submissions Due: April 25, 2022**

For further details, and to submit your work, please see the conference
web site at <https://pact-2022.github.io>.

**FIXME** Add final conference URL once available.

## Scope

2022 will mark the 31st edition of the International Conference on
Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT). PACT is a
unique technical conference that sits at the intersection of parallel
architectures and compilers. The PACT conference series brings together
researchers from architecture, compilers, execution environments,
programming languages, and applications, to present and discuss their
latest research results.

Our current plan is to hold PACT 2022 as a in-person event, after two
consecutive virtual conferences. However, because of the uncertainty on
the evolution of the pandemic and various travel restrictions, we still
may need to revise those plans. We will make this decision some time in
the Spring of 2022.

We solicit contributions in a broad range of topics, including (but not
limited to) the following:

-   Parallel architectures and computational models
-   Compilers and tools for parallel computer systems
-   Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures
-   Compiler/hardware support for hiding memory latencies
-   Support for correctness in hardware and software
-   Reconfigurable parallel computing
-   Dynamic translation and optimization
-   I/O issues in parallel computing and their relation to applications
-   Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications
-   Middleware and run time system support for parallel computing
-   Application-specific parallel systems
-   Applications and experimental systems studies of parallel processing
-   Relevant aspects of distributed computing and mobile computing
-   Heterogeneous systems using various types of accelerators
-   In-core and in-chip accelerators and their exploitation
-   Applications of machine learning to parallel computing
-   Insights for the design of parallel architectures and compilers from
    modern parallel applications
-   Future parallel systems for beyond Moore's law and/or beyond
    Exascale
-   Quantum computing architecture and technology
-   Programming quantum computers, including compilation, languages, and
    control software
-   Simulation of quantum circuits
