# Call for Papers

{{ conf_name }} will be held on {{ conf_dates }} in **Chicago, IL**.

**Submissions Due: {{ submission_deadline }}**

For further details, and to submit your work, please see the conference
web site at <{{ conf_root_url }}>.

## Scope

2022 will mark the 31st edition of the International Conference on
Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT). PACT is a
unique technical conference that sits at the intersection of parallel
architectures and compilers. The PACT conference series brings together
researchers from architecture, compilers, execution environments,
programming languages, and applications, to present and discuss their
latest research results.

Our current plan is to hold PACT 2022 as an in-person event, after two
consecutive virtual conferences. However, because of the uncertainty on
the evolution of the pandemic and various travel restrictions, we still
may need to revise those plans. We will make this decision some time in
the Spring of 2022.

We solicit contributions in a broad range of topics, including (but not
limited to) the following:

-   Parallel architectures and computational models
-   Compilers and tools for parallel computer systems
-   Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures
-   Compiler/hardware support for hiding memory latencies
-   Support for correctness in hardware and software
-   Reconfigurable parallel computing
-   Dynamic translation and optimization
-   I/O issues in parallel computing and their relation to applications
-   Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications
-   Middleware and run time system support for parallel computing
-   Application-specific parallel systems
-   Applications and experimental systems studies of parallel processing
-   Relevant aspects of distributed computing and mobile computing
-   Heterogeneous systems using various types of accelerators
-   In-core and in-chip accelerators and their exploitation
-   Applications of machine learning to parallel computing
-   Insights for the design of parallel architectures and compilers from
    modern parallel applications
-   Future parallel systems for beyond Moore's law and/or beyond
    Exascale
-   Quantum computing architecture and technology
-   Programming quantum computers, including compilation, languages, and
    control software
-   Simulation of quantum circuits

## Code of Ethics and Policy Against Harrassment

All individuals participating in PACT or involved with its organization
are expected to follow the

- [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), and the
- [Policy Against Harrassment at ACM activities](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment).

## ACM Publication Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging
that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications
Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM's new
[Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and
Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).
Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be
investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in
addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID
ID](https://orcid.org/register), so you can complete the publishing process for
your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have
recently made a [commitment to collect ORCID
IDs](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs) from all of our
published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a
requirement throughout 2022.  We are committed to improve author
discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community
efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
