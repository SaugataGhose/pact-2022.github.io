    # Submissions

    ## Publication Date

    The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made
    available in the ACM Digital Library or IEEE Xplore. This date may be up
    to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official
    publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to
    published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are
    published in the ACM Digital Library or IEEE Xplore after the conference
    is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the
    conference.)

    ## Detailed Submission Instructions

    Please make sure that your paper satisfies all of the following
    requirements before being submitted. Submissions not adhering to these
    submission guidelines will be rejected by the submission system.

    -   The paper must have an abstract under 300 words.
    -   The paper must be original material that has not been previously
        published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under
        review by another conference or journal. You may submit material
        presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings.
    -   The submission is limited to eleven (11) pages in the IEEE 8.5" x
        11" (US letter size paper) Two-Column Format using 10pt font, with
        no more than 6 lines per inch. This page limit applies to all
        content NOT INCLUDING references, and there is no page limit for
        references. Your paper must print satisfactorily on both Letter
        paper (8.5"x11") and A4 paper (8.27"x11.69"). The box containing the
        text should be no larger than 7.15"x9.27" (18.2cm x 23.5cm).

    -   Anonymized supplementary material may be provided in a single PDF
        file uploaded at paper submission time, containing material that
        support the content of the paper, e.g., proofs, additional
        experimental results, data sets, etc. Reviewers are not required to
        read the supplementary material but may choose to do so. **The
        supplementary materials can be added as appendix after the reference
        along with the main paper. There is no page limit for the appendix,
        however, please keep it mind that reviewers are not required to read
        the appendix**
    -   Papers are to be submitted for **double-blind review**. Blind
        reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted
        by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are
        to be removed from the submitted paper.
    -   Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g.,
        Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily
        accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide
        anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context.
        Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference
        and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending
        someone else's research.
    -   We realize in doing double-blind review that for some papers it will
        still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission
        will not be penalized as long as a concerted effort was made to
        reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you
        were extending someone else's research. For example, if your name is
        Joe Smith:

        > "In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch
        > predictor for .... In this paper, we extend their work by ..."
        >
        > Bibliography
        >
        > - [1] Joe Smith, "A Parallel Architecture for ...,"
        >   Proceedings of PACT 2004.
        > - \[2\] Joe Smith, "A Compilation Technique for ...,"
        >   Proceedings of PACT 2005.

    -   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and
        not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in
        the paper.
    -   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without
        the aid of a magnifying glass.
    -   Please number the pages.
    -   The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other
        format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive
        it. We suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts:
        Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol.

    ## Conflicts Of Interest

    To ensure a fair and high-quality reviewing process we ask ALL authors
    of a submitted paper to register their conflicts at the submission site.
    If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem
    OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or
    game the review system, the paper may be rejected. Please declare a
    conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your
    paper. Do not limit yourself to only the PC members. A conflict occurs
    in the following cases:

    -   Between adviser and advisee forever.
    -   Between family members forever.
    -   Between people who have collaborated in the last 5 years. This
        collaboration can consist of a joint research or development
        project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the
        potential reviewer (as opposed to company funding) to an author of
        the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as
        tutorials or studies, is not cause for conflict. When in doubt, the
        author should check with the PC chair.
    -   Between people from same institution or who were in the same
        institution in the last 5 years.
    -   Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being
        objective in his/her assessment. Service collaborations, such as
        co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a
        program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves
        create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a
        compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the
        projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the
        different projects.
