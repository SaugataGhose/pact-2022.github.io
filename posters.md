## ACM Publication Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging
that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications
Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM's new
[Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and
Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).
Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be
investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in
addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID
ID](https://orcid.org/register), so you can complete the publishing process for
your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have
recently made a [commitment to collect ORCID
IDs](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs) from all of our
published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a
requirement throughout 2022.  We are committed to improve author
discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community
efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
