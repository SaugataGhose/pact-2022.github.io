<h3>Keynote: Closing the Gap between Quantum Algorithms and Machines with Hardware-Software Co-Design</h3>
<p><strong>Fred Chong</strong> (Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL)</p>
<p>Quantum computing is at an inflection point, where 127-qubit
machines are deployed, and 1000-qubit machines are perhaps only a
few years away.  These machines have the potential to fundamentally
change our concept of what is computable and demonstrate practical
applications in areas such as quantum chemistry, optimization,
and quantum simulation.  Yet a significant resource gap remains
between practical quantum algorithms and real machines.  A promising
approach to closing this gap is to design software that is aware
of the key physical properties of emerging quantum technologies.
I will illustrate this approach with some of our recent work that
focuses on techniques that break traditional abstractions and
inform hardware design, including compiling programs directly
to analog control pulses,  computing with ternary quantum bits,
2.5D architectures for surface codes, and exploiting long-distance
communication and tolerating atom loss in neutral-atom machines.</p>

<h4>Keynote: MemComputing: Fundamentals and Applications</h4>
<p><strong>Massimiliano Di Ventra</strong> (Department of Physics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA)</p>
<p>MemComputing is a new physics-based approach to computation
that employs <em>time non-locality</em> (memory) to both process and
store information on the same physical location. (M. Di Ventra,
<em>MemComputing: Fundamentals and Applications</em>, Oxford University
Press, 2022.) Its digital version is designed to solve combinatorial
optimization problems. A practical realization of digital memcomputing
machines (DMMs) can be accomplished via circuits of non-linear
dynamical systems with memory engineered so that periodic orbits and
chaos can be avoided. A given logic (or algebraic) problem is first
mapped into this type of dynamical system whose point attractors
represent the solutions of the original problem. A DMM then finds
the solution via a succession of elementary avalanches (instantons)
whose role is to eliminate configurations of logical inconsistency
("logical defects") from the circuit. I will discuss the physics
behind MemComputing and show many examples of its applicability
to various combinatorial optimization problems, Machine Learning,
and Quantum Mechanics, demonstrating its advantages over traditional
approaches and even quantum computing. Work supported by DARPA, DOE,

<h4>Keynote: AI Acceleration:  Co-optimizing Algorithms, Hardware, and Software</h4>
<p><strong>Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan</strong> (IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY)</p>
<p>The combination of growth in compute capabilities and availability
of large datasets has led to a re-birth of deep learning. Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have become state-of-the-art in a variety of machine
learning tasks spanning domains across vision, speech, and machine
translation. Deep Learning (DL) achieves high accuracy in these
tasks at the expense of 100s of ExaOps of computation. Hardware
specialization and acceleration is a key enabler to improve
operational efficiency of DNNs, in turn requiring synergistic
cross-layer design across algorithms, hardware, and software.</p>
<p>In this talk I will present this holistic approach adopted in the
design of a multi-TOPs AI hardware accelerator. Key advances in
the AI algorithm/application-level exploiting approximate computing
techniques enable deriving low-precision DNNs models that maintain
the same level of accuracy. Hardware performance-aware design space
exploration is critical during compilation to map DNNs with diverse
computational characteristics systematically and optimally while
preserving familiar programming and user interfaces. The opportunities
to co-optimize the algorithms, hardware, and the software provides
the roadmap to continue to deliver superior performance over the
next decade.</p>

hierarchies of large-scale servers, cache coherence management
of symmetric multiprocessors, accelerators for data analytics
applications and more recently end-to-end accelerator solutions for
AI. Many of her research contributions have been incorporated into
IBM's Power and System-z Enterprise-class servers.</p>
